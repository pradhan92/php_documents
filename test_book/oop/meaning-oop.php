// what is OOP ?

// OOP staands for object-oriented programming.
// OOP is a model of programming.
// oraganies software design with classes and object



// Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in PHP is a programming paradigm that allows developers to create modular,
// reusable, and maintainable code by organizing software design around objects, which are instances of classes.
// In PHP, OOP introduces the use of classes, objects, properties, methods, inheritance, encapsulation, 
// and polymorphism. A class acts as a blueprint for objects, defining the properties (attributes) and methods 
// (functions) that the objects created from the class can have. Inheritance allows one class to inherit the
// properties and methods of another, promoting code reuse. Encapsulation enables restricting access to certain 
// components of an object, enhancing security and modularity, while polymorphism allows objects of different
// classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This approach to programming in PHP makes it easier
// to manage complex applications by promoting a clear and logical structure, facilitating better collaboration 
// and code maintenance.
